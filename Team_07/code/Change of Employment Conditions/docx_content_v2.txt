Change of Employment Conditions Process Data
The data can be grouped into three main categories: data collected at the start, data retrieved for routing, and process status and description data.
1. Application Data (The Initial Request)
This is the core data collected at the start of the process from the "Change of Employment Conditions Application".
Employee Name (employee_name: String): The full name of the employee whose conditions are to be changed.
Proposed Conditions (proposed_conditions: Text): The details of the change, such as the new proposed position, new salary, or other terms.
Change Justification (change_justification: Text): A text field explaining the reason for the change.
Change Effective Date (change_effective_date: Date): The date from which the new conditions should apply.
2. Contextual and Routing Data (Internal System Data)
This is data that the process must look up from internal systems to make decisions and assign tasks.
Is an Academic Teacher? (is_academic_teacher: Boolean): It is used by the gateway "Concerns an academic teacher?" to route the request to either the Chancellor’s or the Rector’s approval path, as defined in the process. The variable should default to TRUE.
3. Process Status and Decision Data (Generated During the Process)
This data is created as the request moves through the approval chain.
Head of O.U. Revie Status (head_of_ou_review_status: String): The outcome of the review by the Head of O.U. (e.g., ‘Approved’, ‘Rejected’, or other description).
PD Review Status (pd_review_status: String): The outcome of the review by the Personnel Department.
KWE Financial Opinion (kwe_financial_opinion: String): The financial opinion from the Quartermaster (e.g., ‘Funds_Available’, ‘No_Funds’).
PRK Opinion (prk_opinion: String): The opinion from the Vice-Rector for Education (if applicable).
PRN Opinion (prn_opinion: String): The opinion from the Vice-Rector for Scientific Affairs (if applicable).
Final Decision (final_decision: String): The outcome (‘Approved’ or ‘Rejected’) set by either the Chancellor or the Rector.
